## Fun project for HackCMU
Motivation: There are various food sources that are free to enjoy everyday (tea parties, piazza, ice creams, etc...). Lots of those food were wasted while people who want those food do not know they even existed. Hence this app aims to guide people who want those free food via a map visualization of free food location shared by other people.
